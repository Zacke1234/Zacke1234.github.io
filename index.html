                        <article> was the third game project I worked on while at future games, developed with Unreal Engine. It's a text story driven game, with a few minigames you will do in a bar. It was a endearing game me & my team made.
                            I worked on the camera switching between scenes, I worked on a highlighting system for the bar minigame, which never got implemented due to time constraints.</article>

                <article>was the second game project I developed at future games, developed with Unreal Engine. It's a boat racing mobile game where you play co-op with someone locally on the same device.
                    I built up the player movement and controls in this game, it was quite the challenge due to how it would interact with the ramps (the game mechanic in this game that let you score points
                    as you played).</article>

                    <article>was the first game project I developed at future games, developed with Unity. It is a first person shooter hoard game, that I also worked on & my team.
                        My contribution in this project was the guns system, the reloading, shooting, swapping of guns was all me, I also made the player movement. one of my 
                        obstacles with this project was getting the player not to slide around everywhere. </article>

                        <article>was the fourth game project I developed at future games, developed with Unreal Engine. Breached is another hoard based shooter game, that I have made with my lovely team over at future games.
                            In breached I have worked on the guns system, the Nitrogenlauncher in this game, was quite the pickle to make though, first I made the hitbox system and collision of it in c++ then I made the rest of it in blueprint. Several times I had difficulties trying to make it work with the enemy blueprints but eventually I got it working.
